# Portfolio Classic Machine Learning
A collection of notebooks illustrating projects which engineer features for machine learning models

## Reducing algorithmic bias in Audio Classification - Full machine learning discovery process.ipynb
Describes a full discovery process from problem identification, feature engineering, model selection and training.
The problem: using short, noisey,  audio clips recorded in 36 different urban locations
- 1. Classify voices contained in the audio as Male or Female.
- 2. During model selection and training, as much as possible, reduce the difference in accuracy between male and female voices.
